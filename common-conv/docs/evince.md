# [evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince)

Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. The goal of evince is to replace the multiple document
viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop with a single simple application.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y evince
```

```bash
# --display=DISPLAY
evince input.pdf
```
